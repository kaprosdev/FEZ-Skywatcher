# Skywatcher

Tool to display and (eventually) edit `.fezsky.json` files for the game FEZ.

### Current intentional limitations
- Effects hardcoded to skies with specific names aren't implemented in the preview. Includes:
	- `INDUS_CITY` glitchy flickering effect
	- `OBS_SKY` altered star opacity range
	- `OBS_SKY` background layer on only one side hack
